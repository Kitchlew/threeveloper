Hey everyone, hopefully you learned something about cameras! Here you will find the source code of the YouTube video `React Three Fiber & Three.js Camera's Explained`. Don't forget to check out the other camera types, so you know what they are meant for:

- [ArrayCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/ArrayCamera)
- [CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera)
- [StereoCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/StereoCamera)

The source code for each videos is seperated into it's own branch. The link to the branch is added to the description of that video.
