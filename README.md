# Threeveloper

Hey everyone 🙋‍♂️

This branch contains the code to debug your own 3D scene UI using tweakpane. Tweakpane is a JavaScript library which makes it possible to add panes to your screen that can be used for fine-tuning parameters and monitoring value changes. Check out their website here: http://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/. Because we are using TypeScript, we'll also use [tweakpane/use-tweaks](https://github.com/tweakpane/use-tweaks) to be able to use react hooks.

Steps to run locally:

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
