# Threeveloper

Hey everyone, this branch contains the code with the end result of the video `React Three Fiber & Three.js - Materials Explained`. Hopefully you learned new stuff that made you even more interested in creating 3D websites! ðŸŽ‰
Feel free to ask me any questions if you have them. You can leave a comment below the video or contact me via any social media which I have linked to in the description of the video.
