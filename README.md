# Threeveloper

Hey everyone, here you can find the final code for the video `React Three Fiber & Three.js Materials Explained`. It includes all the textures that have been used in the code as well, which I downloaded from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/) and edited for demoing purposes.

The source code for each videos is seperated into it's own branch. The link to the branch is added to the description of that video.
