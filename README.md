# Threeveloper

Hey everyone, I hope you learned the basics of react-three-fiber! In case you never used three.js before, maybe it's worth to focus on that before you continue this course. Or let me know, because I can adjust my content in case many people prefer three.js content as well. Here you will find the source code of the YouTube video `Learn how to create 3D websites faster with those react-three-fiber basics`.

The source code for each videos is seperated into it's own branch. The link to the branch is added to the description of that video.
